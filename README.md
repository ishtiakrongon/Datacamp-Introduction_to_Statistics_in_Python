# Datacamp-Introduction_to_Statistics_in_Python
 Statistics is the study of how to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. Itâ€™s a hugely valuable tool that can use to bring the future into focus and infer the answer to tons of questions. 


For example, what is the likelihood of someone purchasing your product, how many calls will your support team receive, and how many jeans sizes should you manufacture to fit 95% of the population? In this course, I have discovered, how to answer questions like these. I have also learned how to calculate averages, use scatterplots to show the relationship between numeric values, and calculate correlation.

### Introduction to Statistics

#### What is statistics?

- **The field of statistics** :- The practice and study of collecting and analyzing data
- **A summary statistics** :- A fact about or summary of some data

#### What can statistics do?

**Example**


- How likely is someone to purchase a product? Are people more likely to purchase it if they can use a different payment system?
- How many occupants will your hotel have? How can you optimize occupancy?
- How many sizes of jeans need to be manufactured so they can fit 95% of the population? Should the same number of each size be produced?
- A/B tests: Which ad is more effective in getting people to purchase a product?

#### Types of statistics

| Descriptive statistics | Inferential statistics|
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Describe and summarize data | Use a sample of data to make inferences about larger population |

#### Types of data

<table>
<tr>
<th>Numeric (Quantitative)</th>
<th>Categorical (Qualitative)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Continuous (Measured)</br><li>Airplane speed</li> <li>Time spent waiting in line</li></td>
<td>Nominal (Unordered)</br><li>Married / Unmarried</li> <li>Country of residence</li></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Discrete (Counted)</br> <li>Number of pets</li><li>Number of packages shipped</li></td>
<td>Ordinal (Ordered)</br><li>Strongly disagree</li> <li>Somewhat disagree</li> <li>Neither agree or disagree</li> <li>Somewhat agree</li><li>Strongly agree</li></td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Descriptive data example

- Given data on every customer service made , what's the average time it took to respond?
- Given data on all 100,000 people who viewed an ad, what percent of people clicked on it?

#### Inferential data example
- Given data on 20 fish caught in a lake, what's the average weight of all fish in the lake?
- After interviewing 100 customers, what percent of all your customers are satisfied with your product?
