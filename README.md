# Datacamp-Introduction_to_Statistics_in_Python
 Statistics is the study of how to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. Itâ€™s a hugely valuable tool that can use to bring the future into focus and infer the answer to tons of questions. 


For example, what is the likelihood of someone purchasing your product, how many calls will your support team receive, and how many jeans sizes should you manufacture to fit 95% of the population? In this course, I have discovered, how to answer questions like these. I have also learned how to calculate averages, use scatterplots to show the relationship between numeric values, and calculate correlation.
